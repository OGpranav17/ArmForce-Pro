# 🌸 Schedyulah — A Pinterest-Inspired Productivity Timer

**Schedyulah** is a beautifully designed productivity timer that lets users track the time they spend doing meaningful, focused work — with an aesthetic experience inspired by Pinterest and Notion.

Whether you're studying, coding, or journaling, Schedyulah asks:

> **“What activity are you indulged in right now?”**

Once answered, the app starts a clean, custom timer page with the activity name. You can start/stop the timer at will and view your **total productive time** vs **idle time** with a single click.
